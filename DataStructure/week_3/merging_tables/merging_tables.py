week 3-3 Merge Tables

In this problem, your goal is to simulate a sequence of merge operations with tables in a database.
Problem Description
Task. There are 𝑛 tables stored in some database. The tables are numbered from 1 to 𝑛. All tables share
the same set of columns. Each table contains either several rows with real data or a symbolic link to
another table. Initially, all tables contain data, and 𝑖-th table has 𝑟𝑖 rows. You need to perform 𝑚 of
the following operations:
1. Consider table number 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖
. Traverse the path of symbolic links to get to the data. That
is,
while 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 contains a symbolic link instead of real data do
𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 ← symlink(𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖)
2. Consider the table number 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖 and traverse the path of symbolic links from it in the same
manner as for 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖
.
3. Now, 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 and 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖 are the numbers of two tables with real data. If 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 ̸=
𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖
, copy all the rows from table 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖 to table 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖
, then clear the table 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖
and instead of real data put a symbolic link to 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖
into it.
4. Print the maximum size among all 𝑛 tables (recall that size is the number of rows in the table).
If the table contains only a symbolic link, its size is considered to be 0.
