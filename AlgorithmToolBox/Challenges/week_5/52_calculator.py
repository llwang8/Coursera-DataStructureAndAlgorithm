week 5-2 Primitive Calculator

You are given a primitive calculator that can perform the following three operations with the current number 洧논: multiply 洧논 by 2, multiply 洧논 by 3, or add 1 to 洧논. Your goal is given a positive integer 洧녵, find the minimum number of operations needed to obtain the number 洧녵 starting from the number 1.
